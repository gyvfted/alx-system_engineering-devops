**Postmortem: The Great Web Stack Outage of April 10, 2024**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** April 10, 2024, 10:30 AM - 12:15 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Our Medical Outreach Management System took an unexpected coffee break, leaving users high and dry. 100% of users were stuck twiddling their thumbs instead of accessing the system.
- **Root Cause:** It turns out our database connection pool was playing hard to get, limiting connections like it was guarding the last slice of pizza.

**Timeline:**
- **10:30 AM (UTC):** Monitoring alarm blares like a car alarm at 3 AM, alerting us to the database connection errors.
- **10:35 AM (UTC):** Investigation begins, with engineers diving into database connectivity and server logs like detectives hunting for clues.
- **10:50 AM (UTC):** Initially suspecting the database server, we call in the database team for backup.
- **11:00 AM (UTC):** Database team uncovers the misconfigured connection pool, the culprit behind the drama.
- **11:15 AM (UTC):** Incident escalates to the development team, who don their capes and prepare to save the day.
- **11:30 AM (UTC):** Database connection pool gets a stern talking-to and is reconfigured to allow more connections.
- **12:00 PM (UTC):** Service slowly limps back to life as the connection pool changes take effect.
- **12:15 PM (UTC):** Full service recovery! Crisis averted, virtual high-fives all around.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The database connection pool was being a bit too stingy, limiting connections and causing a traffic jam.
- **Resolution:** We sat the connection pool down for a chat, reconfiguring it to allow more connections and keep things flowing smoothly.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:** 
  - Implement automated monitoring for database connection pool metrics, like giving it a Fitbit to track its heart rate.
  - Enhance database connection pool configuration management to prevent future stinginess.
- **Tasks:**
  - Patch database connection pool configuration to prevent recurrence, like giving it a better attitude.
  - Add automated alerts for abnormal database connection pool behavior, like installing a smoke detector.
  - Conduct a thorough review of other critical system configurations, making sure they're all playing nicely.

**Conclusion:**
The Great Web Stack Outage of April 10, 2024, taught us the importance of keeping a close eye on our database connection pool and making sure it's in a good mood. Through quick thinking and a bit of reconfiguration, we were able to restore service and prevent future outages. Remember, even the most stubborn connection pool can learn to share!
